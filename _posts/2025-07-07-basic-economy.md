In the book "Basic Economics" written by Thomas Sowell, at the end of it there are questions with answers that can be found in the book. Here is the list of the Questions and Answers;

# PART I: PRICES AND MARKETS
1. Can there be a growing scarcity without a growing shortage -- or a growing shortage without a growing scarcity?

    Response:

    First scarcity and shortage must be defined. Scarcity means fewer goods are available relative to the population. Shortage means needed goods are not available or cannot be obtained in sufficient amounts.

    In the book a prime example for this is the housing shortage in USA after the Second World War. Even thought the ratio between housing and population was similar to the one before the war a shortage of housing occurred. This phenomenon appeared because of the rent control laws that imposed a lower price and increased the demand for housing.
    Because of this some people used more housing that usual and in consequence other people found less housing available. 
    Also,  just as there can be a shortage without scarcity, there can be scarcity without increased shortage.

    A prime example for this is the case of catastrophe. Keeping in the context of housing, after the San Francisco fire from 1906, when more than half the housing capacity got destroyed. This created in three days a great scarcity of housing, but since there was no price control implemented, a shortage was not present.

2. Can a decision be economic, if there are no money involved? Why or why not?

    Response:

    Most of everyday decisions are actually based on economical principles, and most of them confront the classical problem of allocating scarce resources which have alternative uses.

    Prime example: doctors at a hospital must sort the patients on the basis of their affections and resources needed to treat that affection.    

3. Can there be a surplus food in a society where people are hungry?

    Response:

    These cases can happen when price controls on agriculture products are implemented.

    Example: In the great depression, in order to keep the prices high for  agricultural products, the US government implemented various measures for this.
    One of them was the government was to buy surpluses from farmers such as corn, rice, tobacco and wheat. At a point 25% of all wheat in the country was bought by the government in order to keep the price high.
    Meat, dairy and cereal surpluses were literarily destroyed in the destroyed at a time were people suffered from malnutrition.

4. When a housing shortage suddenly disappears, within a time period too short for new housing to have been built, and yet people no longer have any trouble finding a vacant home or apartments, what has probably happened? What will probably happen in the longer run?

5. Which of the following are—or are not—affected by price
controls that limit how high the product’s price can go: (a) the
quantity supplied, (b) the quantity demanded, (c) the quality of
the product, (d) a black market for the product, (e) hoarding of
the product, (f) the supply of auxiliary services that usually go
with the product, or (g) efficiency in the allocation of resources?
Explain in each case. (a: pages 41–44; b: pages 39–41; c: pages
49–50, 51–53; d: pages 50–51, 53; e: pages 48–49; f: page 42; g:
pages 52–53, 64–65)
6. Building ordinary housing and building luxury housing involves
using many of the same resources, such as bricks, pipes, and
construction labor. How does the allocation of these resources
between ordinary housing and luxury housing tend to change
after rent control laws are passed? (pages 43, 47)
7. Are prices usually higher or lower in low–income
neighborhoods? Why? Include among prices the interest rate on
money borrowed and the cost of getting paychecks cashed.
(pages 66–68)
8. When a government institution or program produces counterproductive results, is that necessarily a sign of irrationality or incompetence on the part of those who run that particular institution or program? Explain with examples. (pages 70–72)

9. We all consider some things more important than others. Why then can there be a problem when some oﬃcial government policy establishes “national priorities”? (pages 77–78)

10. We tend to think of costs as the money we pay for things. But does that mean that there would be no costs in a primitive society that did not yet use money or in a modern cooperative community, where people collectively produce the goods and services they use and do not charge each other for them? (pages 22, 28)

11. How does rent control affect the average number of persons per apartment and the average amount of time that the same persons stay in the same apartment? (pages 39–41)

12. Back in the days of the Soviet Union, the government owned and operated most of the enterprises in the economy. Most prices were set by central planners, rather than by supply and demand, and the success or failure of Soviet enterprises was judged primarily by how well they met the numerical targets for production, which were set by the central planners. Specify ﬁve ways in which this arrangement produced diﬀerent economic end results from those in market economies. (pages 17, 22–23, 27, 71, 73–74)

13. How can the price of baseball bats be affected by the demand for paper or the price of catchers’ mitts be aﬀected by the demand for cheese? (page 20)

14. Why are price controls likely to cause more of a shortage of gasoline than of strawberries? (page 49)

15. How does rent control aﬀect the quality of housing and the average age of housing? (pages 41–42)

2. Why has Toyota manufactured cars with only enough inventory of parts to last a few hours? Why did Soviet industries have nearly enough inventory to last for a year? (page 136)

3. Why do American manufacturers of computers or television sets tend to have them transported by others while Chinese manufacturers tend to transport them themselves? (page 135)

4. How did the movement of population from rural to urban America aﬀect the economics of retail selling in the early twentieth century? How did the later movement of population from urban to suburban America in the second half of the twentieth century aﬀect the economics of department stores and grocery stores? Explain with examples. (pages 92–93, 96–97)

5. Why is it that General Motors can make millions of automobiles, without making a single tire to go on them, while Soviet enterprises not only tended to make all their own components, but sometimes even made the bricks for the buildings in which they operated? (pages 130, 134)

6. How did diseconomies of scale in agriculture aﬀect the way tractor drivers plowed ﬁelds in the Soviet Union? What if agricultural enterprises had been privately owned and the tractor drivers were plowing their own ﬁelds? Would the work have been done diﬀerently and would the farm be likely to be as large? Explain why or why not. (pages 123–124)

7. When an economic project such as building a railroad or creating an airline requires far more money than any given individual can or will invest, what are some of the things that can facilitate or impede the pooling of the money of millions of people to ﬁnance the project? (pages 140–142)

8. Advertising, even when it is successful, is often considered to be a beneﬁt only to those who advertise, but of no beneﬁt to consumers, who have to pay the cost of the advertisements in the higher price of the products they buy. Evaluate this view from an economic perspective. (pages 120–121, 574–577)

9. “Inertia is common to people under both capitalism and socialism, but the market exacts a price for inertia." Explain how and why inertia among mail order houses, which were the leading retailers in the United States in the early twentieth century, was aﬀected by the rise of department store chains. (pages 96–98, 182)

12. After the A & P grocery chain cut its proﬁt margins on the goods it sold, back in the early twentieth century, its rate of proﬁt on its investment rose well above the national average. Why? (page 118)

13. Why would luxury hotels be charging lower rates than economy hotels in the same city? (pages 126–127) 14. What is the diﬀerence between the government’s protecting competition and protecting competitors? How does that aﬀect the consumers’ standard of living through its eﬀect on the allocation of scarce resources which have alternative uses? (pages 161–165)

15. Stores in low–income neighborhoods tend to charge higher prices, in order to try to compensate for higher costs and for slower rates of turnover in their inventory. What limits the ability of these stores to completely compensate for these higher costs, so as to make the same rates of proﬁts as stores in higherincome neighborhoods? (pages 118–119)

6. Is it possible for per capita income to rise by 50 percent over a period of years while household income remains unchanged over those same years? (pages 202–203)

7. Although maximum wage laws existed long before minimum wage laws, only the latter are common today. However, in those special cases where there have been maximum wage laws—as under wage and price controls during World War II, for example —what eﬀects would such laws have on discrimination against minorities and women? How would maximum wage laws and minimum wage laws diﬀer in their eﬀects on discrimination? (pages 214, 231–233)

8. Does inequality of income tend to be greater or less in the long run than in the short run? Why do many statistics about “the rich” and “the poor” include people who are neither rich nor poor in reality? (pages 199–200)

9. When drivers of municipal transit buses are unionized and paid more than they would be paid in a free, competitive market, what eﬀect does that tend to have on the size of the buses and the waiting time between buses? (page 215)

10. How can differences in the quality of transportation systems or in the level of corruption in diﬀerent countries aﬀect the value of labor? (page 197)

11.

(pages 195–196, 227–228)

12. Why is the productivity of an individual not the same as the efficiency or merit of that individual? Give examples comparing workers in Third World countries with workers in more prosperous countries, and comparing diﬀerent baseball players in diﬀerent kinds of situations. (pages 196–197)

13. It has often been said that, over time, a higher percentage of the nation’s total income goes to high income people. In what sense is this true and in what sense is it not true? (pages 203–207)

15. What are the implications of the fact that most people today reach their peak earnings years at later ages than in generations past—and that these peak earnings are now usually a larger number of times greater than the earnings of beginners than in times past? What further implications does this have for the changing diﬀerences in male and female earnings? (pages 208–209) 

# PART IV: TIME AND RISK

1. Does it make economic sense for a ninety-year-old man, with no heirs, to plant trees that will take 20 years to grow to maturity and bear fruit? (page 292)

2. Businesses raise money by issuing both stocks and bonds but individuals usually raise money by borrowing—the equivalent of issuing bonds. In some circumstances, however, individuals acquire resources by the equivalent of issuing stocks. What are those circumstances? Give speciﬁc examples and reasons. (pages 313–315)

3. Why may the statistics on the known reserves of a natural resource provide a misleading picture of how much of that resource there is in the ground? (pages 294–301)

7. Why would a bus company owned or controlled by the government charge fares too low to replace existing buses as they wear out? What if the executives of a privately owned and privately controlled bus company decided to divert part of the money they received from bus fares toward paying themselves higher salaries, instead of setting aside enough money to replace buses as they wear out? What would happen to the value of the stock in their company and how would the stockholders be likely to react? (pages 337–338)

8. Many poor countries have conﬁscated businesses or land owned by wealthy foreign companies. Why has this seldom made the poor country more prosperous? (pages 340–341)

12. Why do manufacturers in some countries keep an inventory of many months’ supply of the materials needed in production, while manufacturers in some other countries do not keep an inventory of such materials suﬃcient to last all day?

292)

PART V: THE NATIONAL ECONOMY

1. How does the consumer price index tend to exaggerate the rate of inflation and how does that affect our attempts to measure real income? (pages 353–355)

2. Does the presence or absence of property rights make any diﬀerence to people who own no property? For example, are tenants affected economically by whether the community in which they rent apartments or houses allows unbridled property rights or reduces those property rights through zoning laws, open space laws, height restrictions on buildings, or rent control laws? (pages 400–404)

8. In medieval times, the British economy lagged behind that of some economies in continental Europe but, in later centuries, Britain had the leading economy in Europe and led the world into the industrial age. How and why did foreigners play a major role in developing the British economy? (page 398)

9. Those who favor increases in tax rates are often disappointed that the additional revenue turns out to be less than they expected. Conversely, those who fear that cuts in tax rates will substantially reduce the government’s revenues have often been surprised to ﬁnd the government’s revenues rising. Explain both phenomena. (pages 426–428) 10. Even if detailed statistics are available, why is it diﬃcult to compare the national output at the beginning of the twentieth century with the national output at the beginning of the twenty-ﬁrst century, and say by what percentage it has increased? Why is it hard even to say how much prices for particular goods have increased from one century to another? (pages 352–354)

11. Why would an Albanian bank, with 83 percent of the country’s bank deposits, refuse to make any loans? And what were the consequences for the Albanian economy? (page 387)

12. Explain “the fallacy of composition” and give economic examples. (pages 346–347)

432)

PART VI: THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY

2. Although Africa is more than twice the size of Europe, the European coastline is longer than the African coastline. How can that be, and—more important—what are the economic implications? (page 533)

3. If country A can produce a given product more cheaply than country B, what economic reason would cause it to buy that product from country B, instead of producing it itself? (pages 479–483)

7. What are some of the reasons for restrictions on international trade that economists usually recognize as valid? (pages 492–

493)

8. In the absence of restrictions on international trade, would low- wage countries tend to take jobs away from high-wage countries through lower production costs that would allow them to sell at lower prices? Explain. (pages 486–489)

9. The United States has often been a “debtor nation” owing more to people in other countries than people in other countries owe to Americans, while Switzerland has often been a “creditor nation,” to whom others owe more to the Swiss than the Swiss owe to others. What tends to lead to this diﬀerence and is it economically beneﬁcial or harmful to Americans or Swiss? (pages 506–507)

10. How did the cultural universe and the disease universe of Europeans diﬀer from that of the indigenous peoples of the Western Hemisphere, as of the time when they ﬁrst came in contact with each other? Explain why—and the economic implications of those diﬀerences. (pages 539–541, 565–566)

11. If, instead of having international trade restrictions that save perhaps 200,000 jobs, the European Union allowed free trade and paid $100,000 to each individual who lost a job as a result, would the European Union come out ahead ﬁnancially? (pages 498–499)

12. “Theoretically, investments might be expected to ﬂow from where capital is abundant to where it is in short supply, much like water seeking its own level.” What are some of the reasons why countries with abundant capital seldom invest much of it in countries where capital is much more scarce? (pages 503–505)

4. What is the point of having diﬀerent brands of the same product if in fact all the brands are of pretty much the same quality and sell for about the same price? What would happen in this situation if laws did away with brands, so that each consumer could only identify what the product was, but not who made it? (pages 574–578)

5. For about a century—from the 1770s to the 1870s—most of the leading economists believed that the relative prices of goods reﬂected their relative costs of production, especially the amount of labor they required. What are some of the problems with that theory? (pages 607–611) 6. Explain how the presence or absence of the proﬁt motive aﬀects an organization’s likelihood of achieving the purpose for which it was created, to the maximum extent possible with the resources at its disposal. (pages 578–580)

7. During the era before there were laws against racial discrimination in employment, were black chemists more likely to be hired in proﬁt-making businesses or in non-proﬁt organizations such as colleges and universities—and why? (pages 581–582)

8. Critics have claimed that proﬁts exceed the value of the services performed by those who receive those proﬁts. What empirical evidence could be used to test this belief? (pages 582–583)

9. When ﬁghting a war leads to a diversion of a substantial amount of resources from civilian to military purposes, most people would be more concerned to see that the poor could still get bread than that the rich could still get caviar. Then why not put price controls on bread but not on caviar? (pages 628–629)

10. Some people regard economics as just the opinions of economists, reﬂecting their various ideological biases. Examine that belief in the light of the history of economics. (pages 621–

622)

11. Can government–imposed prices for medical care reduce the costs of that care? (page 573)

12. It is common for politicians to set out to create a law or policy to solve a particular economic problem, and many in the media and among the public urge them to do that. In the light of economic theory in general, and general equilibrium theory in particular, what is wrong with that approach? (pages 612–613)

13. Where do natural disasters like earthquakes or hurricanes do the most damage in terms of financial costs and in terms of loss of human lives? (page 587)

14. A government oﬃcial in India said: “I don’t want multinational companies getting rich selling face creams to poor Indians.” What does that statement imply? (pages 589–590)

15. Nobel Prize winning economist F.A. Hayek said: “We shall not grow wiser before we learn that much that we have done was very foolish.” What do you consider to be the three most foolish policies discussed in this book? Would you have considered those policies foolish before reading Basic Economics?
