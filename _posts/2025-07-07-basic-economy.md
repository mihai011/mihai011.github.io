In the book "Basic Economics" written by Thomas Sowell, at the end of it there are questions with answers that can be found in the book. Here is the list of the Questions and Answers;

# Part 1: Prices and Markets
1. Can there be a growing scarcity without a growing shortage -- or a growing shortage without a growing scarcity?

    Response:

    First scarcity and shortage must be defined. Scarcity means fewer goods are available relative to the population. Shortage means needed goods are not available or cannot be obtained in sufficient amounts.

    In the book a prime example for this is the housing shortage in USA after the Second World War. Even thought the ratio between housing and population was similar to the one before the war a shortage of housing occurred. This phenomenon appeared because of the rent control laws that imposed a lower price and increased the demand for housing.
    Because of this some people used more housing that usual and in consequence other people found less housing available. 
    Also,  just as there can be a shortage without scarcity, there can be scarcity without increased shortage.

    A prime example for this is the case of catastrophe. Keeping in the context of housing, after the San Francisco fire from 1906, when more than half the housing capacity got destroyed. This created in three days a great scarcity of housing, but since there was no price control implemented, a shortage was not present.

2. Can a decision be economic, if there are no money involved? Why or why not?

    Response:

    Most of everyday decisions are actually based on economical principles, and most of them confront the classical problem of allocating scarce resources which have alternative uses.

    Prime example: doctors at a hospital must sort the patients on the basis of their affections and resources needed to treat that affection.    

3. Can there be a surplus food in a society where people are hungry?

    Response:

    These cases can happen when price controls on agriculture products are implemented.

    Example: In the great depression, in order to keep the prices high for  agricultural products, the US government implemented various measures for this.
    One of them was the government was to buy surpluses from farmers such as corn, rice, tobacco and wheat. At a point 25% of all wheat in the country was bought by the government in order to keep the price high.
    Meat, dairy and cereal surpluses were literarily destroyed in the destroyed at a time were people suffered from malnutrition.
