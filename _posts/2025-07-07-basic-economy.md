In the book "Basic Economics" written by Thomas Sowell, at the end of it there are questions with answers that can be found in the book. Here is the list of the Questions and Answers;

# Part 1: Prices and Markets
1. Can there be a growing scarcity without a growing shortage -- or a growing shortage without a growing scarcity?

    Response:

    First scaricity and shortage must be defined. Scarcity means fewer goods are available relative to the population. Shortage means needed goods are not available or cannot be obtained in sufficient amounts.

    In the book a prime example for this is the housing shortage in USA after the Second World War. Even thought the ratio between housing and population was similar to the one before the war a shortage of housing occured. This phenomenon appeared because of the rent control laws that imposed a lower price and increased the demand for housing.
    Because of this some people used more housing that usual and in consequence other people found less housing available. 
    Also,  just as there can be a shortage without scarcity, there can be scarcity without increased shortage.

    A prime example for this is the case of catastrophe. Keeping in the context of housing, after the San Francisco fire from 1906, when more than half the housing capacity got destroyed. This created in three days a great scarcity of housing, but since there was no price control implemented, a shortage was not present.
